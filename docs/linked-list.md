**A linked list** is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are stored in a sequence. Each node contains two parts:

Data: The actual value or information stored in the node.
Pointer (or Reference): A reference or pointer to the next node in the list.

## Types of Linked Lists :

There are several variations of linked lists:

## Singly Linked List:

Structure: Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
Characteristics: Traversal is possible only in one direction (from the head to the tail).

## Doubly Linked List:

Structure: Each node contains three partsâ€”data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
Characteristics: Traversal is possible in both directions (forward and backward).

## Circular Linked List:

Structure: Similar to a singly or doubly linked list, but the last node's next pointer refers to the first node instead of being null.
Characteristics: No null references at the end; it forms a circular chain.
In circular singly linked list: the last node points back to the head.
In circular doubly linked list: both the first node's previous pointer and the last node's next pointer connect, forming a loop.
